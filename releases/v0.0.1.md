## About gydnc

gydnc (pronounced "guidance") is a command-line tool for managing structured guidance documents for AI agents. It provides a way to create, organize, and retrieve guidance documents that can be used to instruct AI systems.

## Why gydnc?

### Share AI Instructions Across Projects
Traditional AI configuration (like `.cursorrules` files) is tied to individual projects. gydnc allows you to:

- **Centralize guidance**: Create shared repositories of AI instructions
- **Reuse across projects**: Apply the same safety requirements, coding standards, and workflows to multiple codebases
- **Version control guidance**: Track changes to your AI instructions over time
- **Collaborate on prompts**: Share effective AI guidance patterns with team members

### Practical Use Cases
- **Migrate from `.cursorrules`**: Convert project-specific AI rules into reusable guidance entities
- **Maintain consistency**: Ensure AI assistants follow the same safety and quality standards across all your projects
- **Build guidance libraries**: Create hierarchical collections like `must/safety-first` (mandatory rules) and `should/code-style` (recommendations)
- **Cross-repository workflows**: Use the same release processes, testing standards, and development practices everywhere

### Example Configuration
```yaml
# ~/.gydnc/config.yml - Share guidance across multiple projects
storage_backends:
    shared_guidance:
        type: localfs
        localfs:
            path: /path/to/shared-guidance/.gydnc
    project_specific:
        type: localfs
        localfs:
            path: /path/to/current-project/.gydnc
```

### Replace Complex Cursor Rules with One Simple Rule

Instead of maintaining lengthy `.cursorrules` files in every project, you can use gydnc as your only cursor rule:

```markdown
# .cursor/rules/gydnc.mdc - Your only cursor rule
# gydnc-interaction-framework
# Guidance Agent Interaction Framework

## Intent
Ensure effective guidance retrieval and creation through the gydnc CLI tool, adapting to evolving user requests throughout a session.

## Rules

### 1. Guidance Retrieval Workflow
ALWAYS follow this sequence to ensure you have comprehensive guidance:

1. **BEGIN WITH OVERVIEW:** Start EVERY session by getting a complete overview of available guidance:
    ```bash
    # CRITICAL: Get overview of ALL available guidance entities
    gydnc list --json
    ```
    This step is NON-OPTIONAL. You must begin by understanding what guidance is available.

2. **FETCH DETAILED GUIDANCE:** After identifying relevant guidance from the overview, retrieve full details:
    ```bash
    # Get complete guidance content for multiple entities in one command
    gydnc get <entity1> <entity2> <entity3>
    ```

3. **PREFER BATCH RETRIEVAL:** Always fetch multiple relevant guidance entities in a single command rather than separate commands.

4. **RE-FETCH AS REQUESTS EVOLVE:** When the user's request changes direction or introduces new requirements, IMMEDIATELY fetch additional relevant guidance.

### 2. Guidance Creation Workflow
When creating new guidance entities, use these proven patterns:

```bash
# Here-document pattern (recommended)
cat << 'EOF' | gydnc create <alias> --title "Title" --tags "tag1,tag2"
# Your content here
Multiple lines work perfectly
Code blocks are preserved
EOF
```

## Notes
- **ALWAYS start with `gydnc list --json`** - This is mandatory for understanding available guidance
- Never rely solely on the overview - always retrieve full guidance with `gydnc get`
- As user requests evolve, retrieve appropriate additional guidance
- Assume configuration exists - don't run `gydnc init` unless explicitly needed
```

This approach gives you:
- **One rule to maintain**: Instead of duplicating cursor rules across projects
- **Dynamic guidance**: AI pulls relevant instructions based on current context
- **Shared knowledge**: Same guidance available across all your projects
- **Version-controlled instructions**: Track changes to your AI guidance over time

## Features

### CLI Interface

- Retrieve single or multiple guidance documents
- Update content and metadata
- List and filter guidance by tags
- Delete guidance entities

### Storage
- Backend-agnostic architecture
- Filesystem backend included (stores as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter)
- Hierarchical organization with aliases
- Tag-based categorization and filtering

### Output Formats
- Human-readable formatted output
- JSON output for programmatic use
- Batch operations for multiple entities

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

| Platform | Architecture | Download |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Linux** | x86_64 | [gydnc-v0.0.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/ofthemachine/gydnc/releases/download/v0.0.1/gydnc-v0.0.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz) |
| **macOS** | Intel | [gydnc-v0.0.1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/ofthemachine/gydnc/releases/download/v0.0.1/gydnc-v0.0.1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz) |
| **macOS** | Apple Silicon | [gydnc-v0.0.1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/ofthemachine/gydnc/releases/download/v0.0.1/gydnc-v0.0.1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz) |

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ofthemachine/gydnc.git
cd gydnc
make build
sudo mv gydnc /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a guidance repository
mkdir my-guidance && cd my-guidance
gydnc init .

# Set configuration
export GYDNC_CONFIG="$(pwd)/.gydnc/config.yml"

# Create guidance
echo "# Safety Guidelines\nValidate all inputs." | \
  gydnc create must/safety-first --title "Safety First" \
  --tags "quality:safety"

# List and retrieve guidance
gydnc list --json
gydnc get must/safety-first
```

Note: The filesystem backend works well with Git for version control, but Git is not required.
